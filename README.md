This is case study 1 in the Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study
## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst at a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director believes that future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the task is to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently.
## Data
[The previous 12 months of trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) is under the [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is public data that we can use to explore how different customer types are using our bikes. But note that data-privacy issues
prohibit us from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
